Good morning all:
================
    -->db relationships
        -->one to one
            -->
        -->one to many
        -->many to one
        -->many to many
    -->normalizations:
        we will break a lorge table into small tables
        --> we will try to remove duplicates
        --> we have to consider one table as a primary table that means
            we have to key primary key in main table
        -->1 nf
        -->2nd nf
        -->3rd nf
        -->bcnf
        -->forignkey in secondary table

--> navigating request to login form:
        if user not existed it will try to redirect request to login.html page
        -->for that we have to import login_required
            from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
        --> in settings.py we have to mention a statement
                LOGIN_URL= 'login'
